# High precision mapping using LIDAR, GNSS and IMU

I'm going to build a prototype of a mobile mapping system using Lidar, GNSS and IMU modules.
Here are what I have in my hands:

1. Lidar [Livox Mid-40](https://www.livoxtech.com/mid-40-and-mid-100)
2. GNSS Module [Unicorecomm UB4B0M](https://en.unicorecomm.com/products/detail/1) and [Unicorecomm UB482](https://en.unicorecomm.com/products/detail/3)
3. IMU Module [Invensense DK-20789](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/dk-20789/)
4. Antennas [Harxon HX-CH7609A D-Helix](https://en.harxon.com/products-detail.php?ProId=184)
5. SoC Computer [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/)

and some other components for connecting and mornitoring main modules.
